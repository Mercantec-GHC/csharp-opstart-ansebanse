﻿/*
This application manages transactions at a store check-out line. The
check-out line has a cash register, and the register has a cash till
that is prepared with a number of bills each morning. The till includes
bills of four denominations: $1, $5, $10, and $20. The till is used
to provide the customer with change during the transaction. The item 
cost is a randomly generated number between 2 and 49. The customer 
offers payment based on an algorithm that determines a number of bills
in each denomination. 

Each day, the cash till is loaded at the start of the day. As transactions
occur, the cash till is managed in a method named MakeChange (customer 
payments go in and the change returned to the customer comes out). A 
separate "safety check" calculation that's used to verify the amount of
money in the till is performed in the "main program". This safety check
is used to ensure that logic in the MakeChange method is working as 
expected.

//Guided Project – Debug and Handle exception
//Project overview
//You're part of a team that's working on retail-support applications.
//The code that you're developing, the MakeChange method, manages the money till for a cash register application.

//Your application must meet the following specifications:

//A C# console application that simulates daily purchase transactions.
//The application calls the MakeChange method to manage the money till during transactions. MakeChange accepts cash payments and returns change.
//The calling application independently verifies the till balance after each transaction.
//A try-catch pattern is implemented to manage exceptions as follows:

    //Exceptions are used to report and handle any issue that prevents a transaction from completing successfully.
    //Exceptions are created and thrown in the MakeChange method.
    //Exceptions are caught and handled in the calling application.

//An application that simulates transactions and calls the MakeChange method has already been developed. The Starter code project for this Guided project module includes a Program.cs file that includes the following code:

//Simulate transactions: the top-level statements configure application data and simulate a series of transactions using either a small testData array or a larger number of randomly generated transactions.
//Initialize the till: the LoadTillEachMorning method is used to configure the cash register till with a predefined number of bills in each denomination.
//Process transactions: the MakeChange method is used to manage the cash till during purchase transactions.
//Report till status: the LogTillStatus method is used to display the number of bills of each denomination currently in the till.
//Report till balance: the TillAmountSummary method is used display a message showing the amount of cash in the till.
